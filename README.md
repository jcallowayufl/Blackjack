# Blackjack
Blackjack project from COP3502.  A psuedo-simulation that I am making as close to real as possible with constant improvements.

Blackjack folder- The Java version.  Successfully fixed the few errors within, added being able to choose whether an ace was counted as a 1 or an 11. ~350 lines of code.  
BlackjackCSharp- The C# version.  Currently in translation from the Java version.
